# The Quotd API

Quotd is a public API serving quotes and aphorisms to inspire and uplift humanity.

## Getting started

To get started, you may receive a random quote with:

```bash
curl https://api.quotd.io/quotes/random
```

Or a specific quote:

```

You may also access:

- all quotes (`/quotes`)
- a list of categories (`/categories`)
